    <h2>About Factulist</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">A tool for everyday readers to quickly check bias and credibility in news articles.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">How it Works</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>We analyze article text with modern language models (sentence embeddings).</li>
        <li>A classifier predicts bias probability (Neutral, Mixed, Biased).</li>
        <li>Credibility scores come from source analysis + text features.</li>
        <li>Results are simplified into traffic-light bias badges and star ratings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">What Factulist is (and isn’t)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Is:</strong> A guide to help spot patterns of bias and credibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Isn’t:</strong> A replacement for professional fact-checking.</li>
    </ul>
